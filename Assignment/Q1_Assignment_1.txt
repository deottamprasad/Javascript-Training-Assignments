let obj = {
 name:"Harry Potter",
 age: 12,
 address: {
  details: ["4","Privet Drive"],
  area:"Little Whinging",
  city: "Surrey",
  state: "England"
 } 
}
let clone = structuredClone(Object.assign({},obj,{address:{details:["5","Privet Drive"]}}));
console.log(obj["address"]["details"][0]);  //4
console.log(clone["address"]["details"][0]);  //5
clone["name"] = "Deottam Prasad";
console.log(clone["name"]); //Deottam Prasad
console.log(obj["name"]); //Harry Potter
clone["address"]["city"] = "Bokaro";
console.log(clone["address"]["city"]); //Bokaro
console.log(obj["address"]["city"]); //Surrey

So, we can see that I have created a deep copy of the given object obj while changing the obj.address.details[0] = "5".Here I have used Object.assign() for modifying the original object so that we can change the address.details[0] = "5" and used structuredClone() for creating a deep copy for this new modified object.
