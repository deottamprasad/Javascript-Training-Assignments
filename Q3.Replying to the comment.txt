//What's the reason const variable allows us to edit the values inside array or objects?

//The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is //immutableâ€”just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content //is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its properties) can be altered.
//So, even though we are allowed to alter the values inside array and objects, we cant re-assign a different //array or object in the const variable.


//Difference between let and const

//First difference
//We can declare let variables without initializing any values.
//We can't declare const variables without initializing it.

//Second difference
//We are allowed to re-assign values in let variables.
//But we can't re-assign values in const variables.
